## Python quick tries....don't judge

Solution code for the problems. 
(quick "on the train" solutions...as a distraction. Maybe next year I will take it serious from the start.)

1) Quick shell work....
2) Crappy python in two files...ooof.
3) Python...getting better...a bit cleaner.
4) Python...first try worked but didn't return the right results....NFIW! Rewrote and used sets to compare....way better and cleaner!
5) Python...not clean...but model option for the crate movers so that the behavior changes but only a little code. Feel better about it.
6) Python...feeling really good about this one...it was easier so I am sure that is part of it...not a weekend problem. Still. Cleaner, found some logic to do some things I didn't know how to do exactly, but was actually what I wanted to do.
