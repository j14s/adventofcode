Solution code for the problems. 

1) Quick shell work....
2) Crappy python in two files...ooof.
3) Python...getting better...a bit cleaner.
4) Python...first try worked but didn't return the right results....NFIW! Rewrote and used sets to compare....way better and cleaner!
5) Python...not clean...but model option for the crate movers so that the behavior changes but only a little code. Feel better about it.
